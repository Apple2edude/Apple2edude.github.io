**********************************************************

	I HAVE REUSED CODE FROM PREVIOUS ASSIGNMENTS FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT


<head>:

The head tag contains a favicon that is made by me, and a title.

index.html:

This page links back to itself (A1_kr760433/index.html) through the Logo and the "Kareem Rshaidat" header. It also links to "A1_kr760433/about.html" and "A1_kr760433/caseStudies.html". I decided to split the website into two vertical sections; the Header and the Main Body. Throughout the website, this style stays consistent, with the website's links being listed in the Header. The image in the Header section is made by me.

The main body introduces my website to the viewer, linking to the About Me page and the Case Studies page again.  

This page contains all relevant contents of Assignment 3 (other than the dynamically sizing code, thats across all pages). The Form, Color Change, Notification, Event Handler, and Conditionals are all in this page.




about.html:

This page contains the same header content as index.html.

The page talks a little about my academic life and of my learning style, and also specifies an ordered list of the languages I know.




caseStudies.html: 

This page contains the same header content as index.html.

Its main body links to three case studies: Floppy Disk Data Preservation (A1_kr760433/caseStudies/floppyDisk.html), Frivolous Squares (A1_kr760433/caseStudies/frivolousSquares.html), and Photoshop (A1_kr760433/caseStudies/photoshop.html). 




caseStudies/floppyDisk.html: 

This page has an altered header, displaying links to all three Case Studies.

The main body contains text and images that are relevant to the case study. It also contains a non-external video that is my property. However, it does contain an embedded youtube video, which gives information about the Apple//e [1].

relative media links include:
floppyDisk/errorMessage.jpg
floppyDisk/macInternal.png
floppyDisk/corrodedFD.jpg
floppyDisk/macDriveVid.mp4




caseStudies/frivolousSquares.html:

This page contains the same header content as caseStudies/floppyDisk.html.


In this page, the main body describes - through both text and imagery - the finalized layout of a game I developed for CSCI 1105. The text contains an external link to "https://processing.org". It also contains an audio file that was retrieved September 23, 2023. Its license (https://filmmusic.io/standard-license) from the now inactive link allowed for the alteration of the file downloaded from the website, which I cropped so it would seamlessly loop. Some image groups are contained within tables so some form of structure is present. All images in this page are my property.

relative media links include:
frivolousSquares/menu.png
frivolousSquares/difficulty.png
frivolousSquares/howTo.png
frivolousSquares/Settings.png
frivolousSquares/ongoingGame.png
frivolousSquares/gameOver.png




caseStudies/photoshop.html:

This page contains the same header content as caseStudies/floppyDisk.html.

The main body within this page describes my interest in photoshop, and uses screenshots to demonstrate some of my projects. All images in this page are my property.

relative media links include: 
photoshop/websiteLogo.png
photoshop/castle.png
photoshop/castleZoom.png
