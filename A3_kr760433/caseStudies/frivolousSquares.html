				In one of my Intro to Comp. Sci. courses, we made use of Processing, 
				a basic graphics design language based off of Java. In one of our assignments, we were told 
				to make a game which had a points system, visual/audio effects, and a level-end (game over 
				screen or similar). Since I was given enough time, and had the detailed reference documentation 
				offered by Processing, I took it upon myself to create a more complex program than a simple 
				game that would start when you ran the program.

				I designed the Main menu to be as procedural as possible, with a Settings screen for 
				color blindness settings and audio sliders, as well as a How To Play screen to 
				explain the rules of the game to the player. The Start screen leads to an option 
				between Easy, Medium, and Hard, so that the user can pick the difficulty 
				option most suitable for them. Easy and Medium introduced stationary squares (Medium had 
				a shorter timer), and Hard had a short timer with moving squares.

				This is easily my favourite program I have worked on, as I got to develop a game, make a 
				GUI, and got the creative space to try to do what I wanted with the game.
